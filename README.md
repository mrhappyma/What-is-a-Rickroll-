# What is a RickRoll?

## The basis
A Rick Roll, Rickroll, or Rick-Roll is an internet bait-and-switch prank involving a hyperlink that unexpectidly brings the user to the music video for Rick Astley's 1987 song *Never Gonna Give You Up*. As an example, here's a link to [a delicious recipe for cookies](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ).

## Origin

There was a filter on the internet fourm [4chan](https://www.4channel.org/) that would change the word egg to duck. So if you tried to type *egg*, it was replaced with *duck*. If you typed *eggman*, it was replaced with *duckman*. Somebody tried to type *eggroll*, and the filter changed it to *duckroll*. Then somebody created this amazing image of a duck on wheels.

Users then preceded to pull the bait & switch trick with the duckroll. For example, here's a link to [my Nana's recipie for homemade bread](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/305/duckroll169.jpg). You can probobobly see the rest of the story from here. *People started doing the same thing with Astley's song*. What is known as the sort of "official" start of rickrolling was one April 1st when YouTube booby trapped every video on the "fetured videos" page to lead to the song.

## Additional reading

Is this just not enough info for you? There's quite a bit of info about Rickrolling and what it is and some of the first uses of it over on the [Wikipedia article](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling).
There's also [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMW4AqbuSGg) amazing YouTube video that goes way too much into detail if you're the kind of person who appriciates that sort of thing.
