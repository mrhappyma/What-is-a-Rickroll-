# What is a RickRoll?

## The basis
A Rick Roll, Rickroll, or Rick-Roll is an internet bait-and-switch prank involving a hyperlink that unexpectidly brings the user to the music video for Rick Astley's 1987 song *Never Gonna Give You Up*. As an example, here's a link to [a delicious recipe for cookies](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ).

## Origin

There was a filter on the internet fourm [4chan](https://www.4channel.org/) that would change the word egg to duck. So if you tried to type *egg*, it was replaced with *duck*. If you typed *eggman*, it was replaced with *duckman*. Somebody tried to type *eggroll*, and the filter changed it to *duckroll*. Then somebody created this amazing image of a duck on wheels.

Users then preceded to pull the bait & switch trick with the duckroll. For example, here's a link to [my grandmother's recipie for homemade bread](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/305/duckroll169.jpg). You can probobobly see the rest of the story from here, but here it is anyway. *People started doing the same thing with Astley's song*. What is known as the sort of "official" start of rickrolling was one April 1st when [YouTube booby trapped every video on the "fetured videos" page to lead to the song.](https://www.wired.com/2008/04/youtube-rickrol/).
